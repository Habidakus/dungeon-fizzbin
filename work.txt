TODO:
- Name selection should work off prime progression rather than pure RND, requires save game file
- Need to fix sorting after hand-rank, we need to compare all cards, in order of importance.
- Clear out the river at the start of each round (especially if the dwarf leaves the table).
- Passing should start with the same person who discards first, and we should rotate who discards first per hand.
- Achievements: See a <species> leave the table, win more than $ from <species> in a hand, win X times against a <species>
