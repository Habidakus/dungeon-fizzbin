TODO:
- Need to fix sorting after hand-rank, we need to compare all cards, in order of importance. We also need to compare second pair by rank if both cards of the first pair are the same rank (eg: 9966 vs 9955, can't have the 9955 win if the 9 was a better suit).
- Achievements: See a <species> leave the table, win more than $ from <species> in a hand, win X times against a <species>
- Need to put the "eye" icon on cards in the nonNPC player's discard pile (eg; when playing against humans)
- Need to add the Why/Who/What pages
- Need to upload to github
- If you never put any money in past ante, it's not an intersting game achievement.
