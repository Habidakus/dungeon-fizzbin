This was mostly created so that I could learn to Godot with C#. This was never intended to be a polished final product, and I set a limit of around 200 hours to devote to this game, 

The idea of the game is that you're playing rounds of draw poker with fantasy species (elves, dwarves, etc...), but the rules to the game change based on who is seated at the table. Although the player can acquire wealth, the ultimate goal of the game isn't to win vast riches but instead to figure out just how the game changes based on each species.

If you found any enjoyment in it, that's above and beyond any expectations on my part.
